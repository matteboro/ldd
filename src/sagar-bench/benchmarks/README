Filenames are indicative of the arguments passed to "diamond" to
generate them. In general, a filename beginning with "diamond.X.Y.Z"
means that it was generated with "--branch X --depth Y --vars
Z". Further components of the filename indicate other options to
"diamond". For example, a filename starting with "diamond.X.Y.Z.tvpi"
means that it was generated with the "--tvpiCons" option.
