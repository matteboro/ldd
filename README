This is the pre-alpha release of the Linear Decision Diagram (LDD)
library. The library is released under a modified BSD license. See
LICENSE for details.

To compile, run "make" in the top level directory. This will compile the
included CUDD library and the LDD library.

To generate doxygen documentation, run "make doc" in the top level
directory.

The API provided by LDD are similar to CUDD. Some examples can be
found in "src/test". Note that all side-effect free CUDD funcions
(e.g., Cudd_DagSize) can be applied to LDDs directly.
