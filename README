This is the pre-alpha release of the Linear Decision Diagram (LDD)
library. The library is released under a modified BSD license. See
LICENSE for details. The license for CUDD is in cudd-2.4.2/LICENSE.

To compile, run "make" in the top level directory. This will compile the
included CUDD library and the LDD library.

To use the library, you must:

1) Add src/include to your compiler include path (-I).
2) Link with all .a files in src/lib.

To generate doxygen documentation, run "make doc" in the top level
directory.

The API provided by LDD are similar to CUDD. Some examples can be
found in "src/test". Note that all side-effect free CUDD functions
(e.g., Cudd_DagSize) can be applied to LDDs directly.
